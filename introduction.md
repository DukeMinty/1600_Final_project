### What are digital file systems? 
A digital file system is "the underlying software framework that defines how data is stored, organized, and retrieved from a storage device." **(TheLinuxCode)**. I.e. your hard drive, flash drive, etc.. File systems enable users and application programs to easily access and manage files without worrying about low-level details.

### Why are there so many?
Different file systems exist to balance different priorities for each user. Not all file systems serve the same overall purpose. "Different file systems have different ways of organizing their data. Some file systems are faster than others, some have additional security features, and some support drives with large storage capacities. Some file systems are more robust and resistant to file corruption, while others trade that robustness for additional speed." **(How-To Geek)**. Having one file system that aims to be good at all of these things is impossible; some file system priorities contradict each other, so multiple versions exist to satisfy the different balances.

## How do I know which one to use?

Some file system types only work with specific OS', or are incapable of handling the file types/transfers that you may be using.

The following pages will introduce each ones' benefits and limits so that you can decide for yourself how to format your drives.

Chances are that you could benefit from switching your file system to a new type. I did.
